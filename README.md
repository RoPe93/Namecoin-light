# Namecoin-light
A lightweight p2p resolver for Namecoin names. Allows for thin clients to lookup namecoin .bit websites without needing the full namecoin blockchain


- This is still on the early POC stage. Not production ready at all. Just wanted to be able to get it infront of the community. 


*WIll add the todos, along with the milestones etc on the wiki soon.
